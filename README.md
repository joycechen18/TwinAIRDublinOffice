![TwinAIR](https://github.com/joycechen18/TwinAIRDublinOffice/blob/main/building.jpg?raw=true)


## Table of Contents
- The dataset is published on Smart Citizen Platform: [SCK Data](https://smartcitizen.me/kits/) and [PurpleAir online repository](https://api.purpleair.com)

- The data from SCK platform contains the follwoing parameters: [Data variables - PM2.5, PM10, PM1, TVOCs, Temperature, Relative Humidity, Noise Level, etc.](https://docs.smartcitizen.me/#measurements)

- The historical data from the TwinAIR consortium is available via the Smart Citizen [API](https://developer.smartcitizen.me/?shell#summary)
- The data is processed to a CSV file and email to the user.

Notes: (a) Office rooms and indoor and outdoor monitoring setting, showing sensors placement. (b) Operational co-located PurpleAir sensors and reference instruments at ambient site.

## Main variables
- Smart Citizen Kits (SCK) and PurpleAir (PA) were deployed for outdoor and indoor monitoring. 
- The PurpleAir (PA-II, PMS5003) contains two particle counters (Channel A and Channel B), and sensors for barometric pressure, Temperature and Relative Humidity. 

## Code
Data processing for this project was executed using the R progamming language. The result is reproducible if one obtains code and input data. 


## Output
The final outputs consist of findings on background and local contributions and traffic-related pollutant hotspots in Dublin, Ireland. The associated results include:

- Time series comparison of outdoor PM2.5 and PM10 from reference Air Quality Monitoring Station using LCS Smart Citizen Kit and PurpleAir ![Low cost sensor and reference site measurement](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1309104225002533-gr2.jpg)

- Time variation plots of corrected 24-h averaged PM2.5 readings from the SCK and PA sensors
